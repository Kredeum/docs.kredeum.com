# Mint your NFTs directly in your Wordpress media library

To Mint (or create) NFTs, you must have **Metamask** installed, and an account on the mainnet **Ethereum**, **Matic/Polygon** network (here is [a good tutorial](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844) on how to do that), **BSC** network or **Fantom** network, with some crypto amounts.

Then go to the **Media** page of your WP Admin, if not yet connected with Metamask, you can click on one **Connect Metamask** button

If not yet connected to Metamask, you'll need to click on "Connect to Metamask"

To MINT a NFTs form one of your media, just click the **MINT NFT** button

You will have to **accept the MINT transaction**, so you need some Matic Token to pay gas cost, but this will cost you much less than a cent of 0,001 $

Now you \*\*NFT is minted \*\*, and you can [**sell it on a NFT MarketPlace**](3.-sell.md) !
