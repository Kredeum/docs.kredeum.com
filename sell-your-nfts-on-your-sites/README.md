# Sell your NFTs on your sites !

You can can create different types of NFT collections inside our NFT Factory:

* **Basic** type collection: **OpenNFTs** (_OpenNFTs generic Collection: anyone can Mint NFTs in this collection!)_
  * You can sell your NFTs on NFT marketplaces as OpenSea
* **Royalties** type collection: **AutoMarket** (_AutoMarket ownable OpenNFTs Collection: own your collection, mint and sell your NFTs with royalties)_
  * You can sell your NFTs directly on your wordpress sites without asking your users to buy on external and centralised NFT marketplaces with dedicated **SHORTCODES**
  * You can even ... sell your NFTs on any websites with our "**BUY SNIPPET**"
  * You can use the standard royalties

Please find a wordpress page example: [https://www.kredeum.org/sardaigna/](https://www.kredeum.org/sardaigna/) that has been created with wordpress kredeum shortcodes, displaying automatically NFT images and then allowing users to sell and buy NFTs directly on this wordpress page !
