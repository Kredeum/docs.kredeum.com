# NFTs Settings

In this **NFTs Settings** page you can configure access keys to your IPFS pinning service. _Dont' forget to click **Save Changes** after entering your key and secret_

Kredeum NFTs plugin uses free [NFT Storage service](https://nft.storage). You need add your account id in the settings page as all Kredeum NFTs are decentralized stored on IPFS. Then all NFTs assets stay immutable.

If not yet done, you can connect to your Metamask while clicking on **Connect Metamask** button
