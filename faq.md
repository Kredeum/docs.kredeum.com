    _This beta feature is already included in dev version... (see 5/)_

    Collection NFTs that you can exchange on whatever Open Marketplace... like OpenSea for example.
3.  **Do you support ERC115 ?**

    Currently Kredeum NFTs plugin mint ERC721 NFTs and can display most of your NFTs ERC721 or ERC1155 (depends on the network)

    In the future ERC1155 may be used to implement mulmedia NFT types : i.e. sounds, videos, pdf, etc...
4.  **For pictures that I already have in my library... should I re-upload them so they get IPFS archived?**

    No, that's not needed, just follow the instruction here : [user-guide/archive](https://docs.kredeum.tech/user-guide/archive)
5.  **Where can I find the beta version ?**

    You can find latest dev version on the WordPress portal, in the link at the bottom of this page : [https://wordpress.org/plugins/kredeum-nfts/advanced/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kredeum-nfts/advanced/)

    _Access to some beta feature, will be soon available on stable version_
6.  _**What type of media can I Mint ?**_

    At the moment, you can Mint images (jpeg, png types). 

    Kredeum NFTs roadmap included other types like video, sound, pdf, etc... 
7.  **Do I have to pay Kredeum to Mint NFTs ?**

    The quick answer is No.

    The detailed answer is a bit longer : to Mint NFTs you will need to pay gas to the blockchain, that can be about 0 $ on some blockchain (like Ploygon), but can be very expensive on others, more than 50 $ (on Ethereum blockchain). No fees are required to Mint by Kredeum smartcontrat, but that may evolve in the future depending on Kredeum NFTs business model (but only apply on future Collections, not retro-active)

    In next version with "presonalized collection" a fee will be needed to create your own NFTs Collection. Then the fees needed for Minting, or Exchanging NFTs of this collection, will be your choice, a mimimum Kredeum fee could be included (like OpenSea does).
