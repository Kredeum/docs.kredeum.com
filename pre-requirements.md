# Pre-requirements

Please find pre-requirements before using Kredeum NFTs DAPP or Wordpress plugin:

1. Need to install Metamask extension on your chrome browser + create Metamask account: [https://metamask.io/download.html](https://metamask.io/download.html)
2. Connect to your Metamask account on Chrome and add at least one Kredeum compatible blockchain networks (Polygon / Matic, Fantom, Avalanche, BSC for cheap transactions or Ethereum). Here is a [tutorial](https://community.metamask.io/t/how-to-add-custom-networks-to-metamask-like-binance-and-polygon-matic/3634#how-to-add-a-custom-network-on-metamask-10) to add networks to Metamask.
3. Buy native cryptocurrency and transfer your new tokens to your Metamask account to be able to create NFT collections and NFTs. Careful native cryptocurrencies are different from Ethereum tokens. You can use bridges to buy native cryptocurrencies like [Polygon bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/) or [direct onramp solutions](https://global.transak.com/)
4. We also recommend to create your [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) accounts if you want to sell your Kredeum NFTs
